Stradex features a SoftPot linear resistor to emulate the violin's fingerboard, four custom force-sensitive keys to emulate the strings, and three potentiometers for range & modulation control. This setup allows Stradex to generate pitch bends, vibrato, dynamic expression, and incredible range, all while remaining intuitive for the average string player.
